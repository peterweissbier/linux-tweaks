How to compile stuff with all cores/threads

Check how many threads your processor cores has with:

lscpu | grep -E '^Thread|^Core|^Socket|^CPU\('

output in my case:

[kaatayra@deepcool ~]$ lscpu | grep -E '^Thread|^Core|^Socket|^CPU\('
CPU(s):                             12
Thread(s) per core:                 2
Core(s) per socket:                 6
Socket(s):                          1
CPU(s) scaling MHz:                 59%

that would mean that i have 12 threads which i can use for compiling. if you want to be a bit on the safe side use 11 threads to compile.
now add or edit this file with the number of your threads. 

MAKEFLAGS='-j12'

/etc/make.conf
